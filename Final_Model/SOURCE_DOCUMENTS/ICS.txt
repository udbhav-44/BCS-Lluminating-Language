The Institute Counselling Service is your home away from home. We are a team of professional counsellors, empathetic students and faculty advisors to assist you emotionally and academically.
Events
Orientation
Quoting our alumni, “Orientation is one of the best memories of IITK." The Institute Counselling Service conducted a 11-day long Orientation for the new Freshers batch to help them get acclimatized to campus and bond with their batchmates. It is the largest College Orientation programme in the nation. Students are introduced to Academic Structure, Administrative Structure, Students' Gymkhana, Clubs & Societies and the various opportunities IITK has for its students. Orientation also contains games, wing activities, interactive sessions and a campus tour with the aim to nurture the newly formed bonds among the students. Memories made here stay forever.
Suicide Prevention Day
World Suicide Prevention Day is an awareness day observed on 10 September every year to provide worldwide commitment and action to prevent suicide with various activities worldwide since 2003. IIT Kanpur also organises events every year to raise awareness that suicide is preventable and to decrease stigma regarding suicide. This year the Institute Counselling Service conducted a seminar, which included a talk by the renowned psychiatrist of Kanpur, Dr Kalim Ahmed.
Mental Health day
On the occasion of mental health day, the Institute Counselling Service conducted various inspiring events to bring attention to Mental health wellness. A Mental health awareness talk was organised to have an open interaction of the campus community with the counsellors to share their thoughts and learn about the importance of mental health in a person's life. There were many fun activities for the audience to have fun while learning to take care of their mental health. The session was followed by a movie screening of "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", which portrays the life of a teenager & his struggles with his post-traumatic stress disorder as he goes through his journey in high school.
Hakuna Matata
Every year on Diwali, we organize 'Hakuna Matata'. Since many students celebrate Diwali away from home, we take the initiative of making students feel at "Home away from Home" by conducting various fun-filled activities to engage the students in positive gainful activities and let off steam under Hakuna Matata. This year, the celebration included a Rangoli Competition in collaboration with the Fine Arts Club. Following this, the day ended with students flying Sky Lanterns and decorating the ground with Diyas marking the Festival of lights.
Academic Remedial Classes
Academic Remedial classes, otherwise known as AM Classes, are sessions organised to cover the syllabus of the first year courses and to gear up the students for upcoming exams. These classes are meant to clear any doubts, solve questions and cover the course content concisely and clearly from an exam point of view. These sessions are headed by Academic Mentors who also prepare short notes and discuss questions keeping in mind the past year's question trends.
Run and Walk for a Cause
A 5km Run and Walk event with the theme "Run and Walk for a Cause" was also held for the campus community to spirit up the mental health day and bring the attention of the importance of mental health. The Marathon started at OAT and continued all through the Campus. Goodies, along with energy drinks, were also distributed to the participants.

Sessions
The Institute Counselling Service organizes numerous sessions throughout the academic year aimed at sensitizing the campus community on issues related to mental health, emotional quotient and general well-being, and some fun events. Sessions are also aimed at acquainting students about various internship opportunities, and promoting senior-junior interaction.

We aim to try and solve problems faced by academically weaker students to help them cope with the academic system of the institute. Remedial classes are conducted and one to one mentoring is offered for these students. Remedial classes are conducted at regular intervals and on demand near quizzes/exams at institute level as well as hall level for 1st year and 2nd year courses. The aim of these classes, rather than to provide a parallel tutoring system, is to cover topics at a ground level so as to clear concepts and provide motivation for the topics being studied. These classes are held regularly during whole semester and help the student to perform better in their exams. Structure of classes are designed such that basic of the course contents can be easily understood. These classes are further sub-categorized into three :
1. Institute level Remedial classes
2. Hall Level Remedial Classes
3.One to One mentoring.

Institute Remedial Classes
Institute level Remedial classes are organized by the Institute Counselling Service in order to provide help in understanding courses and clearing doubts, if any. The main aim for organizing these classes are to clear common doubts in the course and to provide a platform for students to strengthen their basics.
These classes aren't meant to be substitutes for regular lectures. It is highly recommended not to miss any lecture assuming that a remedial class will be held. Remedial classes do not cover all course content, and are conducted at a very slow pace.
Hall Level Classes
Hall Level Classes are held in the respective halls(hostels). This initiative is taken in the under-graduate Halls of Residence to increase the student-mentor interaction. These classes are generally held a week before exams to help a student to clarify their common doubts and help them in solving tricky numerical problems.
One To One Mentoring
One-to-one mentoring is a means to address academic problems of students at an individual level, especially for those who aren't able to match other students' pace in a class and/or are hesitant to talk about problems that they are facing publicly.

Student Benevolence Fund Scholarship
Students' Benevolence Fund (SBF) scholarship is awarded to all the registered students who are not receiving any other financial assistance and are facing financial hardships.
